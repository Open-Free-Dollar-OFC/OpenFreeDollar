# Problem
The internet Computer doesn't yet have  any stable coin in place  and does not have plans to integrate one in its road map and yet stable coins are essential for the Internet Computer ecosystem, especially in DeFi and NFTs
ICP is still volatile and cannot be used in the open market and requires cycles to power canisters.The whole idea is not clear.
